# README Documentation

### I choose the "Testimonials Grid" Challenge. I thought it would be mid-level dificulty. Boy was I wrong! lol This project had me up until the wee hours of the morning trying to reseach and figure out how to render it properly.

### My approach was to still try to make it look similiar as possible but also interactive. So, I added a transition. I had an extremely difficult time with getting the quotation mark added to the background and the grid redering properly. I'm sure that I have a bald spot because of trying to discover a solution for both! lol If I had more time I'd go back in figure out why my text on the "Kira" card is pushed to the bottom.
